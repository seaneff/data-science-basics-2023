# Getting set up

During this workshop, we will be using R and R Studio. Please do your best to download both R and R Studio on the laptop you plan to use (Mac, Windows, or Linux laptops are all ok). 

We'll discuss how to do this on the first day of the workshop, and set aside some time for troubleshooting together if you need any extra help. If you do not have access to a laptop, or are not able to install R or R Studio, you are still more than welcome to attend the workshop and follow along with the materials.

### Install R

Download R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Install RStudio Desktop

Download RStudio Desktop [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).

If you'd like some additional support downloading either R or RStudio Desktop, please see the online book ["An Introduction to R"](https://intro2r.com/installing-rstudio.html), which contains some information on getting set up, including helpful videos.
