Day 3 Optional Exercise
================
Day 3, Data Science Basics in R Workshop

This is an optional exercise to practice what we learned in today's workshop. 
Depending on timing, we will either work through it together as a group, or you can try it out on your own whenever you'd like.

The file [day3-exercise.R](https://github.com/seaneff/data-science-basics-2023/tree/main/day3/optional-exercise/day3-exercise.R) contains some instructions included as comments in the code. The goal of this exercise is to explore, make mistakes, google your error messages, and learn! 

Please reach out in class tomorrow or via email if you ran into any issues and want a little bit of extra help.
