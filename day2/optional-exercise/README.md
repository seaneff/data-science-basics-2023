Day 2 Optional Exercise
================
Day 2, Data Science Basics in R Workshop

This is an optional exercise to practice what we learned in today's workshop. 
Depending on timing, we will either work through it together as a group, or you can try it out on your own whenever you'd like.

The file [day2-exercise.R](https://github.com/seaneff/data-science-basics-2023/tree/main/day2/optional-exercise/day2-exercise.R) contains some instructions included as comments in the code. The file [day1-exercise-solutions.R](https://github.com/seaneff/data-science-basics-2023/tree/main/day2/optional-exercise/day2-exercise-solutions.R) contains some possible solutions if you'd like to check your work.

If you decide to do these exercises, I strongly recommend working through them on your own before you peek at the solutions. You can always pull up the course slides and examples if you want a reminder or need a bit of extra help!
